# Expenses project in React.

This project is based on Maximilan Schwarzmuller react course on Udemy. 
It covers all the topcis that react developer should know.

### May 8th. Learned what is two-way binding and bottom-up connection. 

### May 9th. Learned what is condional rendering, improved State knowledge, learned some React features, dynamically rendering, and using "keys". On the first try its kinda hard but with time it will get easier :).

### May 10th. Improved using map method, changed the colors, of application, added a filter that shows every motnh and progress bars with Expenses at given month. Project is completed, but I think in some free time I will add some upgrades.
